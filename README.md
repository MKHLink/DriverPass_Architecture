# DriverPass 
The DriverPass project strives to streamline driver’s license test preparation and scheduling. Our client, DriverPass, required an integrated system to support users with test preparation materials, scheduling tools, and real-time location tracking. This system  assist students in preparing for their driving test while providing convenient scheduling and offline video streaming capabiliteis.

# Project Details
One area of success was the detailed UML documentation, which effectively mapped out the required use cases, interactions, and data flows. The use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams captured the system’s key functionalities clearly, providing a robust foundation for implementation. This structure not only helped maintain clarity throughout the design phase but also ensured that all client requirements were integrated logically and cohesively.

# Areas for Improvement
If I were to revise one part of the documentation, it would be the class diagram. Given the complexity of the system, there are some cases that did not make it into the final design. I would also like to make use of the premium version of Lucidcharts, as the version I used was rather limiting.

# Interpreting and Implementing User Needs
Interpreting the user’s needs was a core focus of the design process. I implemented this by creating use cases that reflected real world usage and mapped them to the specific business requirements. This user-centric approach allowe me to ensure the system is not only functional but also aligned with the business's operational goals. This approach helped me design a software that adds value to our cleint's prtfolio.

# Approach to Software Design
When designing software, I take a balanced approach between functionality and user-centered design. Starting with business requirements gathering, I use those requirements to create the UML diagrams for the applciation structure in order to ensure correct functionality. For future projects, I plan to further refine my approach with use of agile methodologies, user feedback, and design improvements that reflect users and business feedback.
